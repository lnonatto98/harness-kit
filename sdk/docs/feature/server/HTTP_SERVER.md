# HTTP SERVER AND DOCKER ADAPTER
Expose jobs through a non-interactive HTTP daemon.

## OVERVIEW
Use `HttpServer` as an inbound adapter over application use cases. Resolve project workspaces and queue jobs.

## API ENDPOINTS

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/orchestrator/run` | Enqueue job. |
| POST | `/orchestrator/jobs/{id}/resume` | Resume job. |
| GET | `/orchestrator/status/{id}` | Read job. |
| DELETE | `/orchestrator/jobs/clean` | Purge jobs and worktrees. |
| POST | `/orchestrator/sync`, `/orchestrator/webhook/sync` | Fetch base branch. |
| GET, POST | `/orchestrator/settings` | Manage settings. |
| GET | `/orchestrator/tokens`, `/orchestrator/telemetry/tokens` | Query telemetry. |
| GET | `/orchestrator/reports/summary` | Aggregate costs. |
| GET | `/health`, `/docs`, `/docs/openapi.json` | Read health or API docs. |

## REQUEST CONTRACT

REQUIRED: Send registered `project` and `agent`, unique `idempotencyKey`, and non-empty `scope`.
ALLOWED: Set `score` from 0.1 to 1, `reworks` from 1 to 10, and initial `steeringMessage`.
ALLOWED: Resume failed or aborted jobs with an optional `steeringMessage` only.
REQUIRED: Use `OpenApiSpecGenerator.ts` as endpoint contract source.
PROHIBITED: Send multiple projects, filesystem paths, `branch`, `baseBranch`, `useWorktree`, or `skipDeploy`.
REQUIRED: Use **fast** mode: refinement off, validation and memory on. Omit `mode` or send `"fast"`.
PROHIBITED: Send another `mode`, `refine`, `enableRefinement`, `skipValidation`, or `skipMemory`; return HTTP 400 before queueing.

## CONFIGURATION

| Name | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `port`, `host` | Listener binding | `3000`, `0.0.0.0` |
| `allowedWorkspaces` | Workspace allowlist | `[]` |
| `auth` | No-auth, Basic, Bearer, JWT, or HMAC | No auth |
| `maxConcurrency` | Concurrent jobs | `4` |
| `PROJECT_MAPPINGS` | Project, workspace, and Git mapping | Environment-defined |

## BEST PRACTICES

REQUIRED: Validate input with `DtoMappers`.
REQUIRED: Persist `.harness-kit/settings.json` per project.
REQUIRED: Derive worktrees from job IDs and configured base branches.
REQUIRED: Keep failed job worktrees for resume; reuse the original worktree and branch.
REQUIRED: Complete jobs only when all features are `COMPLETED`.
REQUIRED: Screen sensitive files before job commits.
REQUIRED: Deploy job branches through the server.
REQUIRED: Sync OpenAPI after endpoint changes.
PROHIBITED: Block request handling during agent execution.
